 -I approached the project with a focus on responsiveness and CSS organization using the BEM model.
 
 -Throughout the project, I gained a deep understanding of React's functional components,
 React files and folders and how to use them to create reusable and modular code that was efficient and easy to maintain.
 
 -In addition, I improved my skills in using fundamental CSS properties to achieve the desired layout and design for the restaurant website.
